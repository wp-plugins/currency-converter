== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How frequently are the values updated? =
The table values are updated once a day GMT from central bank and financial institution sources. 

= Can I paste multiple converters, for different currencies? =
Version 2.1 onwards allows multiple currency converters on the same sidebar.

= Why are the prices always favorable? =
The conversion uses a single price value, the mid-price between buy and sell side in the interbank market for the currency in question. The mid-price, by definition, is more competitive than the buy price and sell price for selling and buying respectively. 

= Can I paste the currency converter into a post ? =
Yes, javascript code is available directly from [fx-rate.net](http://fx-rate.net/). You have to paste the javascript into the post in HTML mode.

= Is there support  ? = 
Yes, further support is available at [fx-rate.net/support](http://fx-rate.net/wordpress-currency-converter-plugin/) and [fx-rate.net/conditions](http://fx-rate.net/getwidget_calculator/#conditions)
